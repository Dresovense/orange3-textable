Orange Textable is an open-source add-on bringing advanced
text-analytical functionalities to the `Orange
Canvas <http://orange.biolab.si/>`__ data mining software (itself
open-source). It essentially enables users to build data tables on the
basis of text data, by means of a flexible and intuitive interface, e.
g. count the number of occurrences of certain words in different texts
and display the result with diagrams.

Orange Textable was initially designed and implemented by `LangTech
Sàrl <http://langtech.ch>`__ on behalf of the `department of language
and information sciences (SLI) <http://www.unil.ch/sli>`__ at the
`University of Lausanne <http://www.unil.ch>`__ (see
`Credits <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/credits.html>`__
and `How to cite Orange
Textable <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/citing.html>`__).

-  import in-line XML markup (e.g. TEI)

-  include/exclude segments based on user-defined lists (stoplists)

-  filter segments based on frequency

-  easily generate random text samples

**Advanced text analysis**
--------------------------

-  concordances and collocations, also based on annotations

-  segment distribution, document-term matrix, transition matrix, etc.

-  co-occurrence tables, also between different types of segments

-  lemmatization and POS-tagging via Treetagger

-  robust linguistic complexity measures, incl. mean length of word,
   lexical diversity, etc.

-  many advanced data mining algorithms: clustering, classification,
   factor analyses, etc.

**Text recoding**
-----------------

-  Unicode-aware preprocessing functions, e.g. remove accents from
   Ancient Greek text

-  recode and restructure texts using regexes, e.g. rewrite CSV as XML

**Extensibility**
-----------------

-  handles hundreds of text files

-  use Python script for custom text processing or to access external
   tools: NLTK, Pattern, GenSim, etc.

**Interoperability**
--------------------

**Illustration: mining Humanist**
=================================

The following example is meant to show *what* Orange Textable typically
does, without considering (for now) every detail of *how* it does it.

In a paper reflecting on terminology in the field of Digital Humanities
`[1] <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/illustration.html#id3>`__,
Patrik Svensson compares the evolution of the frequency of expressions
*Humanities Computing* and *Digital Humanities* over 20 years of
archives of the `Humanist discussion group <http://dhhumanist.org/>`__.
He uses these figures to show that while the former denomination remains
prevalent over these two decades, the latter has been quickly gaining
ground since the 2000s.

The same experiment can be run with Orange Textable, by building a
“visual program” like the one shown on figure 1 below:

|Mining Humanist with an Orange Textable schema|

Figure 1: Mining Humanist with an Orange Textable workflow.

Such a program is called a *workflow*. Its visible part consists of a
network of interconnected units called *widget instances*. Each instance
belongs to a type, e.g.
`URLs <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urls.html#urls>`__,
`Recode <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recode.html#recode>`__,
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__,
and so on. Widgets are the basic blocks with which a variety of text
analysis applications can be built. Each corresponds to a fundamental
operation, such as “import data from an online source”
(`URLs <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urls.html#urls>`__)
or “replace specific text patterns with others”
(`Recode <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recode.html#recode>`__)
for example. Connections between instances determine the flow of data in
the workflow, and thus the order in which operations are carried on.
Several parallel paths can be constructed, as demonstrated here by the
`Recode <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recode.html#recode>`__
instance, which sends data to
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
as well as
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__.

Widget instances can be individually parameterized in order to
“fine-tune” their operation. For example, double-clicking on the
`Recode <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recode.html#recode>`__
instance of `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/illustration.html#illustration-fig1>`__
above displays the interface shown on `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/illustration.html#illustration-fig2>`__
below. What this particular configuration means is that every line
beginning with symbol \| or >
(`Regex <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/note_regular_expressions.html>`__
field) should be replaced with an empty string (**Replacement string**):
in other words, remove those lines that are marked as being part of a
reply to another message. There is a fair amount of variation between
widget interfaces, but regular expressions play an important role in
several of them and Orange Textable’s flexibility owes a lot to them.

|Interface of Recode widget in the Humanist example|

Figure 2: Interface of the
`Recode <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recode.html#recode>`__
widget.

After executing the workflow of `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/illustration.html#illustration-fig1>`__
above, the resulting frequencies can be viewed by double-clicking on the
**Data Table** instance, whose interface is shown on `figure
3 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/illustration.html#illustration-fig3>`__
below. On the whole, these figures lend themselves to the same
interpretation as that of Patrik Svensson, but they differ wildly from
the frequencies he reports. This might be explained by the fact that, in
the present illustration, we have used *preprocessed* data made
available on the Humanist website, or it might be that we have not
processed the data exactly like Svensson did. The user can always refer
to the Orange Textable workflow (including the parameters of each
instance) to understand exactly the operations that it performs.
`[2] <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/illustration.html#id4>`__
In this sense, Orange Textable does not only attempt to make the
construction of text analysis programs easier; it aims to make
*communicating* and *understanding* such programs easier.

**Installation**
================

Python 3.x and Orange Canvas 3.x must imperatively be installed *before*
Orange Textable. After installation, Orange Textable appears in the form
of an additional tab in Orange Canvas.

The installation procedure is slightly different on Windows and MacOS X.
`[1] <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#id2>`__

-  `Windows

**Credits**
===========

Textable was initially designed and implemented by `LangTech
Sàrl <http://langtech.ch>`__ on behalf of the `department of language
and information sciences (SLI) <http://www.unil.ch/sli>`__ at the
`University of Lausanne (UNIL) <http://www.unil.ch>`__.

The largest part of funding was initially provided by the Unil’s
Teaching innovation fund (`Fonds d’innovation pédagogique -
FIP <http://www.unil.ch/fip>`__), and led to the release of Textable
v1.0 in summer 2012.

Textable’s development has continued between 2012 and 2013, still
carried on by `LangTech Sàrl <http://langtech.ch>`__, while the program
was being gradually integrated to courses taught at Unil’s department of
`SLI <http://www.unil.ch/sli>`__ (where most of the tutorials that would
later become the Getting started section of this documentation have been
created).

In automn 2013, Textable became a registered Orange Canvas add-on and
was renamed to Orange Textable (v1.3). This promotion has made it
possible to reach a much larger pool of users, as witnessed by a
steadily increasing number of downloads.

In early 2014, Unil’s `FIP <http://www.unil.ch/fip>`__ has renewed its
support to Orange Textable by granting a maintenance funding. This has
made it possible for `LangTech Sàrl <http://langtech.ch>`__ to
collaborate with the creators of Orange Canvas, `University of
Ljubljana’s Biolab <http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/laboratories/biolab/>`__
for producing version v1.4 of Orange Textable.

In the meantime, `UNIL’s Faculty of Arts <http://www.unil.ch/lettres>`__
has granted additional funding for translating Orange Textable’s User
guide from French to English, then converting it into the electronic
form you’re currently reading. UNIL’s `SLI
department <http://www.unil.ch/sli>`__ has provided some financial
support to the project in 2015, which made it possible to handle
warnings and error messages in a more user-friendly fashion in Orange
Textable v1.5.2.

In 2016, funding granted by several sources at UNIL (`SLI
department <http://www.unil.ch/sli>`__, Digital humanities and digital
cultures Lab, `Faculty of
Arts <https://www.unil.ch/lettres/fr/home.html>`__, and `Teaching and
technology support network <https://www.unil.ch/riset/fr/home.html>`__)
has made it possible to port Orange Textable to Python 3, enable it to
deal with very large datasets (with the help of `Arcanite
Solutions <https://arcanite.ch/>`__), as well as improve the ergonomy of
its interface, its presence on the web and its documentation (together
with `Uservalue <https://www.uservalue.ch/>`__).

In 2018, a partnership with the `National qualification programme
(BNF) <https://www.bnf.unibe.ch/index_eng.html>`__ has made it possible
to start updating Orange Textable’s documentation. This effort could
finally be pursued and finished in 2023, when a new subsidy from `UNIL’s
Faculty of Arts <http://www.unil.ch/lettres>`__ made it possible to hire
two student assistants to work on the software’s documentation (Lliana
Doudot) and its performance and responsiveness (Antonin Schnyder).

Besides `LangTech Sàrl <http://langtech.ch>`__ and `Aris
Xanthos <http://www.unil.ch/unisciences/arisxanthos>`__ who have been
involved at about every step of Orange Textable’s conception,
implementation, documentation, and so on, a special mention should be
made to Benjamin Gay (specifications, conception and implementation),
people at `Biolab <http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/laboratories/biolab/>`__
(in particular Blaž Zupan and Aleš Erjavec for conception and
implementation work), Corinne Morey (French to English translation of
the user guide, preparation of the online version of the documentation,
and creation of most cookbook recipes), Douglas Duhaime (case study
design and write-up), and many students (and a growing number of
scholars) mostly at `Unil <http://www.unil.ch>`__ for their
indispensable feedback as users of Orange Textable.

TEXTABLE’S BASICS

This part of the documentation is a tutorial that introduces the basic
usage patterns of Orange Textable. It is meant to be read in the
indicated order. Note that a basic familiarity with the interface of
Orange Canvas is assumed; if needed, `this short
tutorial <http://orange.biolab.si/getting-started/>`__ should provide
you with the necessary background.

1. Segmentations

2. Annotations

3. Tables

4. SEGMENTATIONS

**1. Strings, segments, and segmentations**
===========================================

The main purpose of Orange Textable is to go from text strings to data
tables. As we will see, there are several methods for importing text
strings, the simplest of which is keyboard input using widget `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__.
Whenever a new string is imported, it is assigned a unique
identification number (called *string index*) and stays in memory as
long as the widget that imported it.

Consider the following string of 16 characters (note that whitespace
counts as a character too).

|example1|

Figure 1 : A sample string.

What makes the transition from text strings to data tables possible is
the concept of a *segmentation*. A segmentation is a string analysis
based on an ordered list of *segments*. For instance, a string like “a
simple example” above can be analyzed in many different ways: 3 words,
16 characters, 14 letters, 6 vowels, 3 *e*\ ’s, 2 *mple*\ ’s, etc.

In these examples, all the segments of a given segmentation refer to the
same string. However, the segments of a segmentation can cover different
strings, as in the example below, where the segmentation “a”, “simple”,
“plan” spans two strings (“a simple example” and “what’s the plan”). All
segments referring to a given string must be grouped together, in the
order in which they appear in the string.

|example2|

Figure 2 : A segmentation can span several strings.

**2. Keyboard input, widget labelling and segmentation display**
================================================================

Typing or pasting text in a `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__
widget is the simplest way to import a string in Orange Textable. As a
result, the widget creates a segmentation with a single segment covering
the entire string. (see `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard_input_segmentation_display.html#keyboard-input-segmentation-fig1>`__
below):

|Example usage of widget Text Field|

Figure 1: Typing text in widget `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__.

Each segmentation is identified by a label which is the name of the
widget that creates the segmentation. It is a good habit to rename
widgets to make the label more meaningful. To do so, right-click on the
widget, select **Rename** or press **F2**, then enter the new name.

|Example Widget Label|

Figure 2: Typing an extract of *Salammbô* in widget :ref: Text Field and
giving it a label (*Flaubert*).

This widget’s simplicity makes it most adequate for pedagogic purposes.
Later, we will discover other, more powerful ways of importing strings
such as the `Text
Files <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_files.html>`__
and
`URLs <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urls.html>`__
widgets. These import widgets create a segmentation with one segment for
each imported file or URL.

The
`Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html#display>`__
widget can be used to visualize the details of a segmentation. By
default, it shows the segmentation’s label followed by each successive
segment’s content (see `figure
3 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard_input_segmentation_display.html#keyboard-input-segmentation-fig3>`__
below).

|Example usage of widget Display|

Figure 3 : Viewing *Salammbô* in widget
`Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html#display>`__.

The numbers between square brackets after the segment number constitute
the *address* of the segment, consisting of three elements: 1) string
index 2) initial position within the string 3) final position. The text
corresponding to a given segment is called the segment’s *content*.

By default,
`Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html#display>`__
passes its input data without modification to its output connections. It
is very useful for viewing intermediate results in an Orange Textable
workflow and making sure that other widgets have processed data as
expected.

**3. Merging segmentations together**
=====================================

Computerized text analysis often implies consolidating various text
sources into a single *corpus*. In Orange Textable, this amounts to
grouping segmentations together, and it is the purpose of the
`Merge <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merge.html#merge>`__
widget.

To try out this widget, create on the canvas two instances of `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__,
an instance of
`Merge <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merge.html#merge>`__
and an instance of
`Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html#display>`__
(see `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merging_and_segmenting.html#merging-segmentations-together-fig1>`__
below). Type a different string in each `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__
instance (e.g. *a simple example* and *another example*) and assign it a
distinct label (e.g. *text_string* and *text_string2*). Eventually,
connect the instances as shown on `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merging_and_segmenting.html#merging-segmentations-together-fig1>`__.

|Schema illustrating the usage of widget Merge|

The interface of widget
`Merge <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merge.html#merge>`__
(see `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merging_and_segmenting.html#merging-segmentations-together-fig2>`__
below) features several options. We will return later to their purpose,
let’s leave all boxes unchecked for now.

|Interface of widget merge|

`Figure

above shows the resulting merged segmentation, as displayed by widget
`Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html#display>`__.
As can be seen,
`Merge <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merge.html#merge>`__
makes it easy to concatenate several strings into a single segmentation.
If the incoming segmentations contained several segments, each of them
would appear in the output segmentation.

**Exercise:** Can you add a new instance of
`Merge <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merge.html#merge>`__
to the workflow illustrated on `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merging_and_segmenting.html#merging-segmentations-together-fig1>`__
above and modify the connections (but not the configuration of existing
widgets) so that the segmentation given in `figure
4 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merging_and_segmenting.html#merging-segmentations-together-fig4>`__
below appears in the
`Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html#display>`__
widget?
(`solution <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merging_and_segmenting.html#solution-merging-segmentations-together-ex>`__)

**4. Segmenting data into smaller units**
=========================================

We have seen previously how to combine several segmentations into a
single one. We will often be performing the inverse operation: create a
segmentation whose segments are *parts* of another segmentation’s
segments. Typically, we will be segmenting strings into words,
characters, or any kind of text units that will be later counted,
measured, and so on. This is precisely the purpose of widget
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__.

To try it out, create a new workflow with an instance of `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__
connected to
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__,
itself connected to
`Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html#display>`__
(see `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segmenting_data_smaller_units.html#segmenting-data-smaller-units-fig1>`__
below). In what follows, we will suppose that the string typed in `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__
is *a simple example*.

|Schema illustrating the usage of widget Segment|

Figure 1: A workflow for testing the
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
widget

The interface of
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
(see `figure
2 <https://orange-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merging_segmentations_together.html#merging-segmentations-together-fig2>`__
below) illustrates a feature shared by most Orange Textable widgets: the
**Advanced settings** checkbox triggers the display of more complex
controls offering more possibilities to the user. For now we will stick
to the basic settings and leave this box unchecked.

`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
offers several parameters in the drop-down menu named segment type. Try
using them to segment the text into lines, letters, or words, then check
the result in
`Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html>`__.

The option of using a regular expression is quite powerful and we will
return to it later in this tutorial..

.. _see-also-2:

   widget <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__

-  `Cookbook: Segment text in smaller
   units <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment_text.html>`__

**5. Using a segmentation to filter another**
=============================================

There are many situations where we might want to select or exclude
segments from a segmentation. A typical example is the removal of
“stopwords” (i.e. determiners, pronouns, prepositions, etc.) from a
text, in order to restrict analyses to content words (cf. `an example of
a list of
stopwords <http://members.unine.ch/jacques.savoy/clef/englishST.txt>`__).

The purpose of widget
`Intersect <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intersect.html#intersect>`__
is precisely to solve that kind of problem. It takes two segmentations
in input and lets the user include in or exclude from the first
(*source*) segmentation those segments whose content is the same as that
of a segment in the second (*filter*) segmentation. The widget’s basic
interface is shown on `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_segmentation_filter_another.html#using-segmentation-filter-another-fig1>`__
below.

|Interface of widget Intersect configured for stopword removal|

Figure 1: Interface of widget
`Intersect <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intersect.html#intersect>`__
configured for stopword removal.

The **Mode** option serves to indicate if the segments present in the
filter segmentation should be removed from the source segmentation
(**Exclude**) or, conversely, if they should be retained (**include**);
in the latter case, all the segments *absent* in the filter segmentation
will be removed from the source segmentation. The next step is to
specify which incoming segmentation plays the role of the **Source**
segmentation and the **Filter** segmentation.

In order to try out the widget, set up a workflow similar to the one
shown on `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_segmentation_filter_another.html#using-segmentation-filter-another-fig2>`__
below). The first instance of `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__
(*UDHR)* contains the text to process (for instance the `Universal
Declaration of Human Rights <http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/>`__),
while `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html>`__
(*Stopwords*), contains the list of English stopwords mentioned above.
Both instances of
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
produce a word segmentation (**Segment into words**); the only
difference in their configuration is the widget label , i.e. *Words*
versus *Stopwords*. Finally,
`Intersect <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intersect.html#intersect>`__
is configured as shown on `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_segmentation_filter_another.html#using-segmentation-filter-another-fig1>`__
above.

|Schema illustrating the use of the Intersect widget for stopword
removal|

`Intersect <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intersect.html#intersect>`__
.

The content of the first segments of the resulting segmentation is:

   3. ANNOTATIONS

**1. The uses of annotating segments**
======================================

Annotations are bits of information attached to text segments. They let
you go beyond what’s in the text, and extend Orange Textable’s analytic
capacities from textual content to user-provided interpretative
information and metadata.

In Orange Textable, an *annotation* is a piece of information attached
to a segment. Annotations consist of two parts : *key* and *value*. For
instance, in the now classical case of the word segmentation of *a
simple example*, segment *simple* could be associated with the
annotation *{part of speech : adjective}*; this annotation’s key is
*part of speech* and its value is *adjective* .

|example annotations|

Figure 1 : Annotating *simple* as an adjective.

A segment can have zero, one, or several annotations attached to it. The
same segment could be simultaneously associated with another annotation
such as *{word category : lexical}* , or any *{key : value}* pair deemed
relevant.

|segments with various annotations|

Figure 2 : Segments with various annotations

Note that annotation keys are unique : Since they serve to recognize
various annotation values attached to a single segment, annotation keys
cannot be duplicated within the segment. On figure 2 above, “simple” can
only have one value at a time for key “category” .

Even though they have been ignored so far in this tutorial, annotations
play a fundamental role in text data processing and analysis. They make
it possible to go beyond the basic level of forms that are “physically”
present in a text and tap into the interpretation of these forms–which
is often more interesting.

For instance, the texts composing a given corpus could be annotated with
respect to their genre (*novel*, *short story*, and so on), and the
parts of these texts might be annotated with regard to their discourse
type (*narrative*, *description*, *dialogue*, and so on). Such data
could be exploited to study the distribution of discourse types as a
function of genre, which would be at best extremely difficult, if ever
possible, without having encoded the relevant information by means of
annotations.

Whenever Textable widgets manipulate text contents, they can manipulate
annotations instead: you can search for segments attached to specific
annotations, count annotations, merge data based on their annotations,
etc.

There are several ways of creating annotations in Orange Textable. In
the following section, we will see a simple method based on the
`Merge <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merge.html>`__
widget. Later on in the Tables section, we will discover various ways of
exploiting such annotations.

**2. Annotating by merging**
============================

Widget
`Merge <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merge.html#merge>`__
makes it possible to convert the labels of its input segmentations into
annotation values. Suppose that three instances of `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__
have been created: two instances containing a text in English, and one
containing a text in French. We might want to merge these three
segmentations into a single one, where each segment would be associated
with an annotation whose key is *language* and whose value is either
*en* or *fr*. The first step would then be to rename each `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__

instances.

The three instances of `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__
should then be connected to an instance of
`Merge <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merge.html#merge>`__
as shown on `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merging_annotating.html#annotating-merging-fig2>`__
below.

|Creating annotations with Merge|

`Merge <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merge.html#merge>`__.

One must still specify, in the interface of
`Merge <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merge.html#merge>`__,
the annotation key to which values *en* and *fr* should be associated.
This can be done by entering the string *language* in field **Import
labels with key**, having previously ensured that labels would actually
be converted into annotation values by checking the box at the left of
this line (see figure 3 below).

We also have the option to give a distinct, numeric annotation value to
each segment; to that effect, check the **Auto-number with key** box. A
sensible key for this annotation might be e.g. *num*.

|Importing labels as annotation values with Merge|

The result of these operations can be viewed using an instance of
`Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html>`__,
whose output is shown on figure 4 below. For each segment in the merged
segmentation, an annotation value *en* or *fr* associated with key
*language* is displayed above the segment’s content:

7. TABLES

**1. From segmentations to tables**
===================================

The main purpose of Orange Textable is to build tables based on texts.
Central to this process are the segmentations we have learned to create
and manipulate earlier. Indeed, Orange Textable provides a number of
`widgets for table
construction <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/table_construction_widgets.html>`__,
and they all operate on the basis of one or more segmentations.

For the time being, we will focus on the construction of frequency
tables, which are very common in computerized text analysis and which
will serve as an introduction to other types of tables. For the sake of
simplicity, consider first the segmentation of *a simple example* into
letters. Counting the frequency of each letter type yields a table such
as the following:

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------+
|        |        |        |        |        |        |        |    * |
|  **a** |  **s** |  **i** |  **m** |  **p** |  **l** |  **e** | *x** |
+========+========+========+========+========+========+========+======+
|    2   | 1      | 1      | 2      | 2      | 2      | 3      | 2    |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------+

More often, we will be interested in comparing frequency across several
*contexts*. For instance, if the word segmentation of *a simple example*
is also available, it may be used together with the letter segmentation
to produce a so-called *contingency table* (or *document–term matrix*):

+---------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----+
|               |    * |    * |    * |    * |    * |    * |    * |     |
|               | *a** | *s** | *i** | *m** | *p** | *l** | *e** |  ** |
|               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | x** |
+===============+======+======+======+======+======+======+======+=====+
|    **a**      |    1 | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0   |
+---------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----+
|    **simple** |    0 | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 0   |
+---------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----+
|               |    1 | 0    | 0    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 2    | 1   |
|   **example** |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |     |
+---------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----+

In a real application, rows could correspond to the writings of an
author and columns to selected prepositions, for instance. The general
idea is to determine the number of occurrences of various *units* in
various *contexts*. Such data can then be further analyzed, typically by
means of a statistical test (aiming at answering the question “does the
distribution of units depend on contexts”) or a graphical representation
(making it possible to visualize the attraction or repulsion between
specific units and contexts).

**2. Counting segment types**
=============================

Widget
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__
takes in input one or more segmentations and produces frequency tables
such as tables 1 and 2
`here <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segmentations_tables.html>`__.
To try it out, create a workflow such as illustrated on `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_segment_types.html#counting-segment-types-fig1>`__
below. As usual, we will suppose that the `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__
instance contains *a simple example*. The
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
instance is configured for letter segmentation (**Segment into
letters**). The default configuration of *Data Table* (from the **Data**
tab of Orange Canvas) needs not be modified for this example.

   |Schema for testing the Count widget|

Figure 1: Workflow for testing the
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__
widget.

Basically, the purpose of widget
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__
is to determine the frequency of segment types in an input segmentation.
The label of that segmentation must be indicated in the **Segmentation**
menu of section **Units** in the widget’s interface, while other
controls may be left in their default state for now (see `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_segment_types.html#counting-segment-types-fig2>`__
below). Clicking **Compute** then double-clicking the *Data Table*
instance should display essentially the same data as table 1
`here <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segmentations_tables.html#segmentations-tables-table1>`__
(with possible variations in the order of rows).

   |Counting the frequency of letter types with widget :ref:\`Count\`|

Figure 2: Counting the frequency of letter types with widget
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__.

Note that checkbox *Send automatically* is unchecked by default so that
the user must click on **Send** to trigger computations. The motivation
for this default setting is that `table construction
widgets <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/table_construction_widgets.html>`__
can be quite slow when operating on large segmentations, and it can be
annoying to see computations starting again whenever an interface
element is modified.

To obtain the frequency of letter *bigrams* (i.e. pairs of successive
letters), simply set parameter **Sequence length** to 2 (see `table
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_segment_types.html#counting-segment-types-table1>`__
below). If the value of this parameter is greater than 1, the string
specified in field **Intra-sequence delimiter** is inserted between
successive segments for the sake of readability–which is more useful
when segments are longer than individual letters. Note that in this
example, word boundaries are not taken into account, which is why
bigrams *as* and *ee* have a nonzero frequency.

+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
|      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |

**3. Counting in specific contexts\ **\ `¶ <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_specific_contexts.html#counting-in-specific-contexts>`__
===============================================================================================================================================================

Section **Contexts** of widget
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__\ ’s
interface lets the user define the *contexts* in which units should be
counted. In the example of the `previous
section <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_segment_types.html>`__,
setting **Mode** to **No context** indicated that units were to be
counted *globally* in the selected segmentation; as a result, the
resulting table contained a single column. Orange Textable offers three
other modes corresponding to three different definitions of contexts.

   |Interface of widget Count, Sliding window mode|

Figure 1: Interface of widget
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__,
Sliding window mode.

When **Mode** is set to **Sliding window** (see `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_specific_contexts.html#counting-specific-contexts-fig1>`__
above), context is defined as a “window” of *n* consecutive segments
which “slides” from the beginning to the end of the segmentation. In the
case of the letter segmentation of *a simple example* (as obtained with
the workflow illustrated in the `previous
section <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_segment_types.html>`__),
setting the number of segments in the window (**Window size**) to 5
yields the following successive contexts: *asimp*, *simpl*, *imple*,
*mplee*, *pleex*, and so on (see `table
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_specific_contexts.html#counting-specific-contexts-table1>`__
below). This mode is useful for studying the evolution of unit
frequencies throughout a segmentation.

When **Mode** is set to **Left-right neighborhood** (see `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_specific_contexts.html#counting-specific-contexts-fig2>`__),
context is defined on the basis of adjacent segment types occurring to
the left and/or right of each position.

   |Interface of widget Count, Left-right neighborhood mode|

Figure 2: Interface of widget
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__,
Left-right neighborhood mode.

For instance, setting **Left context size** to 1 and **Right context
size** to 0 amounts to counting the frequency of each segment type given
the type that occurs immediately to its left. This particular table is
often called “transition matrix” (see `table
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_specific_contexts.html#counting-specific-contexts-table2>`__
below). The string selected in the **Unit position marker** string is
used to indicate the position where units appear in the context. Thus,
`table
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_specific_contexts.html#counting-specific-contexts-table2>`__
shows that both *m* and *s* appear once immediately to the right of an
*a* (i.e. in context *a\_*). To take another example, setting **Right
context size** to 2, we would find that *e* occurs once both in context
*l_ex* and *e_xa*.

Finally, when **Mode** is set to **Containing segmentation**, unit types
are counted within the segment types of a second segmentation, as
illustrated in table 2
`here <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segmentations_tables.html#segmentations-tables-table2>`__
(frequency of letters within words). Segment *A* is considered to be
contained within segment *B* if the following three conditions are met:

-  A and B refer to the same string (their addresses have the same
   string index)

-  A’s initial position is greater than or equal to B’s initial position

-  A’s final position is lesser than or equal to B’s initial position

To try this mode out, modify the workflow used in the `previous
section <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_segment_types.html>`__
as illustrated on `figure
3 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_specific_contexts.html#counting-specific-contexts-fig3>`__
below.

   |Schema for testing the Count widget (Containing segmentation mode)|

Figure 3: Workflow for testing the

widget (Containing segmentation mode).

`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
(*words*) produces a word segmentation (**Segment into words**) which
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
(*letters*) further decomposes into letters (**Segment into letters**).
The instance of
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__
is configured as shown on `figure
4 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_specific_contexts.html#counting-specific-contexts-fig4>`__
below. The resulting table is the same as table 2
`here <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segmentations_tables.html#segmentations-tables-table2>`__
(possibly with a different ordering of rows and columns).

   |Interface of widget Count, Containing segmentation mode|

Figure 4: Configuration of widget
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__
for counting letters in words.

Note that in this mode, checking the **Merge contexts** box still
restricts counting to those units that are contained within the segments
of another segmentation, but without treating each context type
separately. In the case of letters within words, there is no difference
between this mode and mode **No context** (see `previous
section <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_segment_types.html>`__).
It does however make a difference in the case of letter bigram counting,
because those bigrams that straddle a word boundary will be excluded in
this case (contrary to what can be seen in table 1
`here <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/counting_segment_types.html#counting-segment-types-table1>`__).

**4. Tagging table rows with annotations\ **\ `¶ <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tagging_table_rows_label_segment.html#tagging-table-rows-with-segments-and-labels>`__
=========================================================================================================================================================================================

There are several situations in which annotations attached to a segment
can be used in place of this segment’s content. A particularly common
case consists in using annotations for tagging the rows of a table built
with a table construction widget.

Consider the example of the texts in English and French introduced here.
Suppose that after having merged them into a single segmentation with
`Merge <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merge.html#merge>`__
(*Texts*) (**Import labels with key:** *language*), we segment these
three texts into letters with
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
(*Letters*), as in the workflow shown on `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tagging_table_rows_label_segment.html#tagging-table-rows-annotations-fig1>`__
below; both segmentations (*texts* and *letters*) can then be sent to an
instance of
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__
for building a table with the frequency of each letter in each text.

   |Counting letter frequency in three texts|

Figure 1: Workflow for counting letter frequency in three texts.

Let us suppose, first, that the instance of
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__
is configured as shown on `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tagging_table_rows_label_segment.html#tagging-table-rows-annotations-fig2>`__
below, so that the definition of contexts–that is, rows of the frequency
table–is based on the content of the three texts.

Here is the resulting table, disregarding possible variations in row
and/or column order:

As can be seen, the default header of each row is the entire content of
each text. While this may not be a problem in a pedagogic example like
this one, it is easy to see why it would compromise the table’s
readability in a real application, where texts often contain thousands
or even millions of characters. To avoid that, it is useful to tag the
table’s rows with annotation values attached to segments rather than
with these segments’ content. To that effect, the desired annotation key
must be selected in the **Contexts** section of widget
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__\ ’s
interface.

   |Tagging contexts with annotation values|

In the example of `figure

above, key *language* has been selected, so that the resulting frequency
table looks like this:

+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

Besides the substitution of segment content by annotation values in row
headers, this example demonstrates an important consequence of this
manipulation: contexts associated with the same annotation value are, in
effect, collapsed together so that they form a single row. If this
behavior is not desired, it can be avoided by assigning distinct
annotation values to the contexts that must be kept separated (e.g. by
labelling the `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html>`__
instances that contain English texts *en_1* and *en_2*).

| ADVANCED TOPICS
| 1. XML

**1. Converting XML markup to annotations**
===========================================

Often, the best way (and sometimes the only way) to add a specific type
of annotation to a text is by “manually” adding it to the data. This is
frequently done with XML markup. For instance, the text that appears in
the `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__
instance of `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/converting_xml_markup_annotations.html#converting-xml-markup-annotations-fig1>`__
below is segmented into words by means of *<w>* tags whose *type*
attribute indicates the “part of speech” associated with each word (e.g.
*DET*, *NOUN*, *PREP*, and so on).

|image3|

Figure 1: Sample text annotated using XML markup.

The role of widget `Extract
XML <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extract_xml.html#extract-xml>`__
is to convert XML markup into annotated segments . In its basic version
(see `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/converting_xml_markup_annotations.html#converting-xml-markup-annotations-fig2>`__
below), the widget’s interface essentially requires the user to specify
the name of the XML tags that must be imported, namely *w* in this
example. The **Remove markup** checkbox indicates whether further markup
(if any) detected *within* imported tags must be removed (there is no
further markup in this example, so that this option has no effect here).

|Interface of the Extract XML widget|

Figure 2: Interface of the `Extract
XML <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extract_xml.html#extract-xml>`__
widget.

After connecting the above `Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__
and `Extract
XML <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extract_xml.html#extract-xml>`__
instances, and the latter to an instance of
`Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html#display>`__,
you can verify that the resulting segmentation contains a segment for
the content of each *<w>* tag in the input text, and that this segment
is annotated with key *type* and value *DET*, *NOUN*, or *PREP* (the
three first such segments are shown on `figure
3 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/converting_xml_markup_annotations.html#converting-xml-markup-annotations-fig3>`__
below). Each attribute-value pair of each XML tag has indeed been
automatically converted to a *{key: value}* annotation.

|Annotations imported using Extract XML|

XML <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extract_xml.html#extract-xml>`__.

   annotations <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/convert_xml_tags_annotations.html>`__

**2. Merging units with XML annotations**
=========================================

Annotations can also be used for merging units during counting
operations in particular. Consider again the example of annotations
extracted from XML data developed
`here <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/converting_xml_markup_annotations.html>`__.
The segmentation produced by `Extract
XML <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extract_xml.html#extract-xml>`__
can be sent to an instance of
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__
as in the workflow shown on `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merging_units_annotations.html#merging-units-annotations-fig1>`__
below.

|Counting segments extracted from XML data|

Figure 1: Counting segments extracted from XML data.

If the *type* annotation key is selected in section **Units** of widget
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__\ ’s
interface (see `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merging_units_annotations.html#merging-units-annotations-fig2>`__
below), the annotation values corresponding to this key (namely part of
speech) will be counted in place of the segments’ content.

|image4|

Figure 2: Merging units using annotation values.

The resulting table is as follows:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| **NOUN**              | **DET**               | **PREP**              |
+=======================+=======================+=======================+
| 3                     | 1                     | 1                     |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Of course, annotations may be used to merge units *and* contexts
simultaneously.

2. REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

**1. A note on regular expressions**
====================================

Orange Textable widgets rely heavily on *regular expressions* (or
*regexes*), which are essentially a body of conventions for describing a
set of strings by means of a single string. These conventions are widely
documented in books and on the Internet, so we will not give here yet
another introduction to this topic. Nevertheless, a basic knowledge of
regexes is required to tap into the real potential of Orange Textable,
and more advanced knowledge to fully unleash it.

The syntax of regexes is partly standardized, but some variations
remain. Orange Textable uses Python regexes, for which Python
documentation is the best source of information. In particular, it
features a good `introduction to
regexes <http://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html>`__. A first reading
might be limited to the following sections:

-  `Simple
   Patterns <http://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#simple-patterns>`__

-  `More
   Metacharaters <http://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#more-metacharacters>`__

Also recommended are the following:

-  `Compilation
   Flags <http://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#compilation-flags>`__

-  `Lookahead
   Assertions <http://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#lookahead-assertions>`__

-  `Greedy versus
   Non-Greedy <http://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#greedy-versus-non-greedy>`__

**2. Partitioning segmentations using a regex\ **\ `¶ <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/partitioning_segmentations.html#partitioning-segmentations-using-a-regex>`__
=====================================================================================================================================================================================

In section `Using a segmentation to filter
another <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_segmentation_filter_another.html>`__,
we have seen how to use the
`Intersect <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intersect.html>`__
widget to exclude a specified list of words (so-called “stopwords”) from
a segmentation. The
`Select <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/select.html#select>`__
widget is tailored for such tasks.

The widget’s interface (see `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/partitioning_segmentations.html#partitioning-segmentations-fig1>`__
below) offers a choice between two modes: *Include* and *Exclude*.
Depending on this parameter, incoming segments that satisfy a given
condition will be either included in or excluded from the output
segmentation. By default (i.e. when the **Advanced settings** box is
unchecked), the condition is specified by means of a regex, which will
be applied to each incoming segment successively. For now, the option
**Annotation key** can be left to its default setting **(none)**.

|Example usage of widget Select|

Figure 1: Excluding short words with widget
`Select <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/select.html#select>`__.

In the example of `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/partitioning_segmentations.html#partitioning-segmentations-fig1>`__,
the widget is configured to exclude all incoming segments containing no
more than 3 letters. Note that without the *beginning of segment* and
*end of segment* anchors (^ and $), all words containing *at least* a
sequence of 1 to 3 letters–i.e. all the words–would be excluded.

Note that
`Select <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/select.html#select>`__
automatically emits a second segmentation containing all the segments
that have been discarded from the main output segmentation (in the case
of `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/partitioning_segmentations.html#partitioning-segmentations-fig1>`__
above, that would be all words less than 4 letters long). This feature
is useful when both the selected *and* the discarded segments are to be
further processed on distinct branches. By default, when
`Select <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/select.html#select>`__
is connected to another widget, the main segmentation is being emitted.
In order to send the segmentation of discarded segments instead,
right-click on the outgoing connection and select **Reset Signals** (see
`figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/partitioning_segmentations.html#partitioning-segmentations-fig2>`__
below).

|Right-clicking on a connection and requesting to "Reset Signals"|

Figure 2: Right-clicking on a connection and requesting to **Reset
Signals**.

This opens the dialog shown on `figure
3 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/partitioning_segmentations.html#partitioning-segmentations-fig3>`__
below, where the user can “drag-and-drop” from the gray box next to
**Discarded data** up to the box next to **Segmentation**, thus
replacing the existing connection. Clicking **OK** validates the
modification and enables the discarded data to flow through the
connection.

|Dialog for modifying the connection between two widgets|

between two widgets.

   pattern <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/include_exclude_based_on_pattern.html>`__

**3. Segmenting with regexes**

This tutorial has already shown how to use the
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
widget to segment text into words, letters, or lines thanks to the
drop-down menu options.

|Interface of widget Segment configured with regex "\\w+"|

Figure 2: Interface of the
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
widget, configured for word segmentation

As a matter of fact, these options in the interface of
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
rely on the use of regular expressions within the widget’s structure.
For instance, the regex \\w+ is used underlying the **Segment into
words** choice. It divides each incoming segment into sequences of
alphanumeric characters (and underscores)–which in our case amounts to
segmenting *a simple example* into three words. A similar operation is
launched with the \\w regex to obtain a segmentation into letters (or to
be precise, alphanumeric characters or underscores).

With some knowledge about regular expressions, you can exploit the **Use
a regular expression** option in the drop-down menu to do more specific
queries. If the relevant unit is the word, regexes will often use the
\\b *anchor*, which represents a word boundary. For instance, words that
contain less than 4 characters can be retrieved with \\b\\w{1,3}\\b,
those ending in *-tion* with \\b\\w+tion\\b, and the inflected forms of
*retrieve* with \\bretriev(e|es|ed|ing)\\b.

In these examples, the same result can be achieved by first using the
built-in **Segment into words** option and filtering the result with the
`Select <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/select.html>`__
widget (see `Using a segmentation to filter
another <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_segmentation_filter_another.html>`__).
However, doing it in one step with
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html>`__
is more effective in terms of computation time. Besides, it makes it
possible to capture text fragments that are larger than words, e.g.
multi-word expressions.

To go further, you can add several regexes at the same time by ticking
the **Advanced settings** checkbox (see figure 3 below). Regexes can
then be used to describe the resulting tokens, as in the basic mode or,
depending on your research goal, to describe the delimiters occurring
between the resulting tokens (selecting mode **Split** instead of
**Tokenize**). For more information, see `Segment
widget <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__.

|\_images/segment_advanced_example.png|

Figure 3: Interface of the
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
widget with **Advanced settings** checked

In several other widgets (`Text
Files <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_files.html>`__,
`URLs <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urls.html>`__,
and
`Recode <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recode.html>`__),
**Advanced settings** also allows you to switch from a single
manipulation to a series of operations. In most widgets, they give
access to additional useful options.

**4. XML annotation-based selection using a regex**
===================================================

Another common way of exploiting annotations consists in using them to
select the segments that will be in-/excluded by an instance of
`Select <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/select.html#select>`__
(see `Partitioning
segmentations <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/partitioning_segmentations.html>`__)
or
`Intersect <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intersect.html#intersect>`__
(see `Using a segmentation to filter

Thus, in the case of the XML data example introduced
`here <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/converting_xml_markup_annotations.html>`__
(and further developed
`there <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merging_units_annotations.html>`__),
we might insert an instance of
`Select <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/select.html#select>`__
between those of `Extract
XML <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extract_xml.html#extract-xml>`__
and
`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__
(see `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xml_annotation_based_selection.html#annotation-based-selection-fig1>`__
below) in order to include only “content words”.

|Inserting an instance of Select to filter a segmentation|

Figure 1: Inserting an instance of
`Select <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/select.html#select>`__
to filter a segmentation.

In this simplified example, the
`Select <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/select.html#select>`__
instance could thus be parameterized as indicated on `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xml_annotation_based_selection.html#annotation-based-selection-fig1>`__
below), so as to exclude (**Mode: Exclude**) those segments whose
annotation value for key *type* (**Annotation key**: *type*) is *DET* or
*PREP* (**Regex:** ^(DET|PREP)$).

**Cookbook**

This section describes how to get a number of basic tasks done with
Orange Textable. Each task is explained by means of a concise,
illustrated recipe. The goal is to provide the user with a set of
elementary operations which, once properly chained, may form the basic
skeleton of various more ambitious projects.

|image7|

Figure 1: Viewing text with an instance of
`Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html#display>`__.

1. Create an instance of
   `Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html#display>`__.

2. Drag and drop from the output (righthand side) of the widget that
   emits the segmentation to be displayed, `here Text
   Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__
   (*Hamlet*), to the input of
   `Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html#display>`__
   (lefthand side).

3. Double-click on the icon of
   `Display <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/display.html#display>`__
   to view the text content. You can show the segmentation in HTML
   format if you check the option (Figure 1)

**Comment**
-----------

-  If the input segmentation is large (>1000 segments), the time
   necessary to display it in HTML format can be prohibitively long. For
   this reason, only the first 5 segments and the last 5 segments are
   displayed by default in this case. If you want all segments displayed
   nevertheless, tick the **Advanced Settings** checkbox then uncheck
   **Limit number of displayed segments**.

-----------

-  The default output encoding is utf8; it can be changed by ticking the
   **Advanced Settings** checkbox.

-  If you rather want to *copy* the text content in order to later paste
   it in another program, click on **Copy to clipboard**.

-  If the input segmentation is large (>1000 segments), only the first 5
   segments and the last 5 segments are displayed, and thus exported, by
   default. If you want all segments exported, tick the **Advanced
   Settings** checkbox then uncheck **Limit number of displayed
   segments**.

-  More options for formatting the exported text are available by
   ticking the **Advanced settings** checkbox.

-----------

-  In the **Regex** field you can use all the syntax of Python’s regular
   expression (*cf.* Regular expressions).

-  In our example, we choose to replace all occurrences of British
   *-our* with American *-or* (for example, from *colour* to *color*);
   unless otherwise specified (typically using word boundary “anchor”
   \\b), replacements will also occur within words, i.e. *coloured* to
   *colored*.

**Comment**
-----------

The XML tags that have been retrieved are actually discarded from the resulting segmentation: only their content is included in the output.
===========================================================================================================================================

The attributes of the XML tags are automatically converted to annotations associated with the created segments.
===============================================================================================================

Note that it is only possible to extract instances of a single XML element type at a time (here w).
===================================================================================================

However, it is possible to chain several `Extract XML <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extract_xml.html#extract-xml>`__ instances in order to successively extract instances of different XML elements. For example, a first instance to extract div type elements, a second to extract w type elements, and so on. In this case, it is important to make sure that the **Remove markup** option is *not* selected.

1. Create an instance of
   `Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__.

2. Drag and drop from the output (righthand side) of the widget that
   emits the segments that will be counted, here
   `Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
   (*letters*), to the `input of
   Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__
   (lefthand side).

3. Double-click on the icon of
   `Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__
   to open its interface.

4. In the **Units** section, select the segmentation containing units to
   be counted in the **Segmentation** drop-down menu (here: *letters*).

5. Click the **Send** button or tick the **Send automatically**
   checkbox.

6. A table showing the results is then available at the output of
   `Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__;

**Comment**
-----------

-  The total number of segments in your segmentation appears at the
   bottom of
   `Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html>`__\ ’s
   interface (here: 14).

-  It is also possible to define units as segment pairs (*bigrams*),
   triples (*trigrams*), and so on, by increasing the **Sequence
   length** parameter in the **Units** section.

-  If **Sequence length** is set to a value greater than 1, the string
   appearing in the **Intra-sequence delimiter** field will be inserted
   between the elements composing each *n*-gram in the column headers,
   which can enhance their readability. The default is # but you can
   change it to the delimiter of your choice.

-  Furthermore, it is possible to count the apparition of units in more
   complex contexts than simply the previous unit, such as: the *n*
   previous units (**Left context size**); the *n* following units
   (**Right context size**); or any combination of both.

-  The **Unit position marker** is a string that indicates the
   separation between left and right contexts sides. The default is \_
   but you can change it to the marker of your choice.

    `Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html>`__
    a recognizable name, such as *query*.

5.  Click the **Send** button or tick the **Send automatically**
    checkbox.

6.  Double-click on the icon of
    `Context <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/context.html#context>`__

7.  In the **Units** section, select the segmentation that contains the
    occurrences of the query string (here: query) using the
    **Segmentation** drop-down menu.

8.  In the **Contexts** section, choose **Mode: Containing
    segmentation** and select the segmentation that contains the
    original text (here: *Hamlet*) using the **Segmentation** drop-down
    menu.

9.  Tick the **Max. length** checkbox and set the maximum number of
    characters that should be displayed on either side of each
    occurrence of the query string.

10. Click the **Send** button or tick the **Send automatically**
    checkbox.

11. A table showing the results is then available at the output of
    `Context <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__;
    to display or export it, see `Cookbook: Table
    output <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook.html#cookbook-toc-table-output-ref>`__.

-  In the **Regex** field of the
   `Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
   widget you can use all the syntax of Python’s regular expression
   (*cf.* Regular expressions); for instance, if you wish to restrict
   your search to entire words, you might frame the query string with
   word boundary anchors \\b (in our example \\bhobbit\\b).

**Case studies**
================

This section aims to provide a repository of use cases illustrating the
application of Orange Textable to realistic text analysis problems. The
focus here is not so much on “how to” as it is on “why”. Each case study
comes with a downloadable Orange Textable workflow that can be studied
interactively and adapted to the specific needs of the user.

-  `Term frequency comparison in Melville's Moby
   Dick <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moby_dick.html>`__

-  `Stylometric analysis of Shakespeare's Titus

**Term frequency comparison in Melville’s Moby Dick**
=====================================================

(This use case was designed with the help of `Douglas
Duhaime <http://douglasduhaime.com/>`__ and the following text was
slightly adapted from a description kindly contributed by him.)

This case study is adapted from Matthew Jocker’s excellent work *Text
Analysis with R for Students of Literature* (46). The goal here is to
visualize the frequency of the terms “Ahab” and “whale(s)” within Herman
Melville’s masterpiece *Moby Dick*. The workflow reproduced on `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moby_dick.html#moby-dick-schema>`__
below retrieves the text from `Project
Gutenberg <https://www.gutenberg.org/>`__, splits the work into its
constitutive chapters, and measures the degree to which each of the
target terms appears in each chapter.
`[1] <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moby_dick.html#id2>`__

|Orange Textable workflow for the Moby Dick use case|

Figure 1: Orange Textable workflow for visualizing term frequency in
*Moby Dick*.

Clicking on the **Scatter Plot** instance, one can easily see the
relative frequency of the term *whale(s)* in each chapter of Melville’s
novel (see `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moby_dick.html#moby-dick-whales-vs-ahab>`__
below). By toggling the **Y-axis Attribute** dropdown box, one can
select *Ahab* and visualize the frequency of *Ahab* in the novel.

|Relative frequency of term "whale(s)" in Moby Dick|

|Relative frequency of term "Ahab" in Moby Dick|

Figure 2: Negative correlation between the relative frequency of terms
*whale(s)* (top) and *Ahab* (bottom) in Melville’s novel.

Although one might have supposed that the distribution of Captain Ahab
would closely resemble that of whales within the novel, the plots above
tell a different story. While Ahab is most present in early and then
later chapters, whales are most present in the novel’s middle chapters,
creating something of an inverse relationship between the two. For the
literary critic, this relationship offers new evidence with which to
evaluate the strategy and structure of Melville’s novel.

**Stylometric analysis of Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus**
==========================================================

(This use case was designed with the help of `Douglas
Duhaime <http://douglasduhaime.com/>`__ and the following text was
slightly adapted from a description kindly contributed by him.)

This is a case study in “stylometry”, or the quantitative analysis of a
writer’s style. The data to be analyzed is William Shakespeare’s play
*Titus Andronicus*, which scholars have long believed William
Shakespeare did not write alone. Since the publication of John
Robertson’s study *Did Shakespeare Write Titus Andronicus*, many have
believed that particular scenes within the text have been written by
other playwrights of the time: many believe that Act 1 Scene 1, for
instance, was written by Shakespeare’s contemporary George Peele.

In order to test this hypothesis, the following Orange Textable workflow
measures the degree to which the language in each scene within *Titus
Andronicus* resembles the language within each other scene (`figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/titus_andronicus.html#titus-andronicus-schema>`__
below).
`[1] <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/titus_andronicus.html#id2>`__
By changing the **Mode** parameter within the **Intersect** instance,
one can elect to focus only on content words or stopwords, and by
changing the **Distance Metrics** parameter within the **Example
Distance** instance, one can change the similarity metric for the
language comparison. Finally, by clicking on the **Distance Map** icon
within this workflow, one can see at a glance how distinct the
vocabulary within each scene is.

|Orange Textable workflow for the Titus Andronicus use case|

Figure 1: Orange Textable workflow for the stylometric analysis of
*Titus Andronicus\**.

Comparing the stopwords within each scene using a normalized Euclidean
distance metric, one finds that Act 1 Scene 1 is indeed a significant
outlier within *Titus Andronicus*. The scene remains an outlier when one
performs TF-IDF normalization on the term-document matrix (within the
**Convert** instance), and when one uses a normalized Manhattan distance
metric. Iterating through each of the various distance metrics, and
toggling between different normalization metrics, Act 1 Scene 1 remains
the most consistent outlier. This adds further evidence to the argument
that the scene’s stylistic fingerprint departs from that of that of the
rest of the play.

|Act 1 Scene 1 of Titus Andronicus is a consistent stylistic outlier.|

Figure 2: Act 1 Scene 1 is a consistent stylistic outlier in
Shakespeare’s play.

**Reference**

This part of the documentation explains the effect of every control of
each Orange Textable widget. The Orange Textable’s widgets are grouped
into 4 main categories based on the type of functionality they offer.
The last section documents the details of JSON formats that can be used
for the configuration of some of Orange Textable’s widgets.

**Text import widgets**
=======================

The common purpose of widgets of this category is to import text data in
Orange Canvas, either from the keyboard (`Text
Field <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_field.html#text-field>`__),
from files (`Text
Files <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_files.html#text-files>`__),
or from the Internet
(`URLs <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urls.html#urls>`__).
They all emit *Segmentation* data.

Inputs:

-  | Text data
   | Segmentation containing text to be edited

Outputs:

-  | Text data
   | Segmentation covering the text displayed in the widget

**Description**
---------------

This widget allows the user to import text from keyboard. It emits a
segmentation containing a single unannotated segment covering the whole
string. Secondarily, **Text Field** can be used to manually edit a
previously imported string.

The interface of the widget mainly consists in . a text field editable
by the user (see figure 1 below). The standard editing functions (copy,
paste, cancel, etc.) are accessible through a right-click on the field
or keyboard shortcuts.

|image27|

Figure 1: Interface of the *Text field* widget.

The **Send** button triggers the emission of a segmentation to the
output connections. When it is selected, the **Send automatically**
checkbox disables the button and the widget attempts to automatically
emit a segmentation at every modification of its interface.

It should be noted that the text field’s content is normalized in three
ways:

-  it is systematically converted to Unicode

-  it is subjected to the `canonical Unicode
   decomposition-recomposition <http://unicode.org/reports/tr15>`__
   technique (Unicode sequences such as LATIN SMALL LETTER C (U+0063) +
   COMBINING CEDILLA (U+0327) are systematically replaced by the
   combined equivalent, e.g. LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA (U+00C7))

-  various forms of line endings (in particular \\r\\n and \\r) are
   converted to a single form (namely \\n)

When\ **Text Field** receives a segmentation in input, the contents of
all incoming segments are concatenated (without adding any delimiters)
and the resulting string replaces the current textual content of the
widget (if any). This allows the user to manually edit text that has
been previously imported in Orange Textable. Some points are worth
noting:

-  This operation creates a distinct string from the one that has been
   previously imported: it really amounts to *copying* the original
   string and making the copy available for manual edition. As such, it
   is prone to a very specific and possibly disconcerting type of error,
   which can be best understood by studying the example given in the
   documentation of
   `Preprocess <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preprocess.html#preprocess>`__
   (section
   `Caveat <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preprocess.html#anchor-to-caveat>`__),
   where what is said about
   `Preprocess <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preprocess.html#preprocess>`__
   also applies to **Text Field**.

-  Modifications brought from within the interface of **Text Field** to
   a string imported in this way will be lost if the **Text Field**
   instance receives a new input on its incoming connection. In
   particular, this will happen if the schema is saved and later
   re-opened. To avoid any loss of data, the safest way to operate is to
   remove the incoming connection as soon as it has been created and the
   string has been copied in the **Text Field** instance’s interface;
   indeed, removing the incoming connection will not remove the imported
   string from the instance’s interface, where it can then be edited
   without risking to overwrite it.

**Messages**

**Description**
---------------

This widget is designed to import the contents of one or several text
files in Orange Canvas. It outputs a segmentation containing a
(potentially annotated) segment for each imported file. The imported
textual content is normalized in several ways:

-  it is systematically converted to Unicode (from the encoding defined
   by the user)

-  it is subjected to the `canonical Unicode
   decomposition-recomposition <http://unicode.org/reports/tr15>`__
   technique (Unicode sequences such as LATIN SMALL LETTER C (U+0063) +
   COMBINING CEDILLA (U+0327) are systematically replaced by the
   combined equivalent, e.g. LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA (U+00C7))

-  it is stripped from the `utf8 byte-order
   mark <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8>`__ (if
   any)

-  various forms of line endings (in particular \\r\\n and \\r) are
   converted to a single form (namely \\n)

The interface of **Text files** is available in two versions, according
to whether or not the **Advanced Settings** checkbox is selected.

**Basic interface**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In its basic version (see `figure
1 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_files.html#text-files-fig1>`__
below), the **Text Files** widget is limited to the import of a single
file. The interface contains a **Source** section enabling the user to
select the input file. The **Browse** button opens a file selection
dialog; the selected file then appears in the **File path** text field
(it can also be directly typed with the keyboard). The **Encoding**
drop-down menu enables the user to specify the encoding of the file or
select (auto-detect) if unsure.

|image30|

Figure 1: **Text files** widget (basic interface).

The **Send** button triggers the emission of a segmentation to the
output connections. When it is selected, the **Send automatically**
checkbox disables the button and the widget attempts to automatically
emit a segmentation at every modification of its interface.

The text below the **Send** button indicates the number of characters in
the single segment contained in the output segmentation, or the reasons
why no segmentation is emitted (no input data, encoding issue, etc.).

**Advanced interface**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The advanced version of **Text Files** allows the user to import several
files at a time; each file can moreover be associated to a distinct
encoding and specific annotation. The emitted segmentation contains a
segment for each imported file.

|image31|

Figure 2: **Text files** widget (advanced interface).

The advanced interface (see `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_files.html#text-files-fig2>`__
above) presents similarities with that of the
`URLs <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urls.html#urls>`__,
`Recode <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recode.html#recode>`__,
and
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
widgets. The **Sources** section allows the user to select the input
file(s) as well as their encoding, to determine the order in which they
appear in the output segmentation, and optionally to assign an
annotation. The list of imported files appears at the top of the window;
the columns of this list indicate (a) the name of each file, (b) the
corresponding annotation (if any), and (c) the encoding with which each
is associated.

In `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_files.html#text-files-fig2>`__,
we can see that two files are imported and that each is provided with an
annotation whose key is *author*. The first file associates value
*Dickens* with this key and is encoded in utf-8; the second one has
value *Fitzgerald* and is encoded in iso-8859-1.

The first buttons on the right of the imported files’ list enable the
user to modify the order in which they appear in the output segmentation
(**Move Up** and **Move Down**), to delete a file from the list
(**Remove**) or to completely empty it (**Clear All**). Except for
**Clear All**, all these buttons require the user to previously select
an entry from the list. **Import List** enables the user to import a
file list in JSON format (see `JSON im-/export
format <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/json_format.html>`__,
`File
list <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/json_file_list.html>`__)
and to add it to the previously selected sources. In the opposite
**Export List** enables the user to export the source list in a JSON
file.

The remainder of the **Sources** section allows the user to add new
files to the list. The easiest way to do so is to first click on the
**Browse** button, which opens a file selection dialog. After having
selected one or more files in this dialog and validated the choice by
clicking on **Open**, the files appear in the **File paths** field and
can be added to the list by clicking on the **Add** button. It is also
possible to type the complete paths of the files directly in the text
field, separating the paths corresponding to the successive files with
the string ” / ” (space + slash + space).

Before adding one or more files to the list by clicking on **Add**, it
is possible to select their encoding (**Encoding**), and to assign an
annotation by specifying its key in the **Annotation key** field and the
corresponding value in the **Annotation value** field. These three
parameters (encoding, key, value) will be applied to each file appearing
in the **File paths** field at the moment of their addition to the list
with **Add**.

The **Options** section allows the user to specify the label affected to
the output segmentation. The **Import filenames with key** checkbox
enables the program to create for each imported file an annotation whose
value is the file name (as displayed in the list) and whose key is
specified by the user in the text field on the right of the checkbox.
Similarly the button **Auto-number with key** enables the program to
automatically number the imported files and to associate the number to
the annotation key specified in the text field on the right.

In `figure
2 <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_files.html#text-files-fig2>`__,
it was thus decided to assign the label *novels* to the output
segmentation, and to associate the name of each file to the annotation
key *filename*. On the other hand, the auto-numbering option has not
been enabled.

The **Send** button triggers the emission of a segmentation to the
output connections. When it is selected, the **Send automatically**
checkbox disables the button and the widget attempts to automatically
emit a segmentation at every modification of its interface.

The text below the **Send** button indicates the length of the output
segmentation in characters, or the reasons why no segmentation is
emitted (no selected file, encoding issue, etc.). In the example, the
two segments corresponding to the imported files thus total up to
1’262’145 characters.

**Remote control**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Text Files** is one the widgets that can be controlled by means of the
`Message <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/message.html#message>`__
widget. Indeed, it can receive in input a message consisting of a file
list in JSON format (see `JSON im-/export
format <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/json_format.html>`__,
`File
list <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/json_file_list.html>`__),
in which case the list of files specified in this message replaces
previously imported sources (if any). Note that removing the incoming
connection from the **Message** instance will not, by itself, remove the
list of files imported in this way from the **Text Files** instance’s
interface; conversely, this list of files can be modified using buttons
**Move up/down**, **Remove**, etc. even if the incoming connection from
the **Message** instance has not been removed. Finally, note that if a
**Text Files** instance has the basic version of its interface activated
when an incoming connection is created from an instance of
`Message <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/message.html#message>`__,
it automatically switches to the advanced interface.

**Table construction widgets**
==============================

Widgets of this category take *Segmentation* data in input and emit
tabular data in the internal format of Orange Textable. They are thus
ultimately responsible for converting text to tables, either by counting
items
(`Count <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/count.html#count>`__),
by measuring their length
(`Length <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/length.html#length>`__),
by quantifying their diversity
(`Variety <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/variety.html#variety>`__).
Widget
`Cooccurrence <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cooccurrence.html#cooccurrence>`__
makes it possible to measure the tendency of text units to occur in the
same contexts, while
`Context <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/context.html#context>`__
serves to build concordances and collocation lists. Finally,
`Category <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/category.html#category>`__
exploits categorical information associated with segmentations.

**Conversion/export widgets**
=============================

The widgets of this category serve diverse purposes unified by the
notion of “conversion”.
`Convert <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/convert.html#convert>`__
takes as input tabular data in Orange Textable format and converts them
to other formats, in particular the *Table* format appropriate for
further processing within Orange Canvas;
`Convert <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/convert.html#convert>`__
also makes it possible to apply various standard transforms to a table,
such as sorting, normalizing, etc., as well as to export its contents in
tab-delimited text format.
`Message <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/message.html#message>`__
takes as input a segmentation containing data in a specific JSON format
(see `Reference: JSON im-/export
format <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/json_format.html>`__)
and converts them to a “message” that can be used to control the
behavior of other widgets.

**JSON im-/export format**
==========================

Beyond a restricted number of sources, substitutions, or regular
expressions, it becomes tedious to configure instances of widgets `Text
Files <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_files.html#text-files>`__,
`URLs <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urls.html#urls>`__,
`Recode <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recode.html#recode>`__,
and
`Segment <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segment.html#segment>`__
using their advanced interface. To alleviate this issue, these widgets
enable the user to import or export manually edited configuration lists
in `JSON <http://www.json.org/>`__ format as described in the following
sections.

*Proposition de mise en page pour “Text input”*

|image68|

-> Quand on appuie sur Text input depuis la table des matières, ça
donnerait ceci (sans la section cookbook apparente):

Début de la page

|image69|

This section will help you do the first step of using the program. It
will show you how to import text for further processing with Orange
Textable by giving you three “recipes” or ways of importing text that
you might find useful.\ |image70|

-  `Import text from
   keyboard <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/import_text_keyboard.html>`__
   if you need to type or paste your text on the keyboard.

-  `Import text from
   file <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/import_text_file.html>`__
   if you need to import the content of one or more raw text files.

-  `Import text from internet
   location <https://orange3-textable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/import_text_internet_location.html>`__
   if you need to import text content located at one or more URLs.
