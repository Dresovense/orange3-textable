Merging segmentations together
=====================================

Computerized text analysis often implies consolidating various text
sources into a single *corpus*. In Orange Textable, this amounts to
grouping segmentations together, and it is the purpose of the
:doc:`Merge <widgets/merge>` widget.

To try out this widget, create on the canvas two instances of 
:doc:`Text Field <widgets/text_field>` an instance of
:doc:`Merge <widgets/merge>` and an instance of
:doc:`Display <widgets/display>` (see :ref:`figure 1 <merging_segmentations_together_fig1>`
below). Type a different string in each :doc:`Text Field <widgets/text_field>`
instance (e.g. *a simple example* and *another example*) and assign it a
distinct label (e.g. *text_string* and *text_string2*). Eventually,
connect the instances as shown on :ref:`figure 1 <merging_segmentations_together_fig1>`.

    widget :doc:`Merge <widgets/merge>`.

The interface of widget :doc:`Merge <widgets/merge>`
(see :ref:`figure 2 <merging_segmentations_together_fig2>` below) features several options. We will return later to their purpose,
letâ€™s leave all boxes unchecked for now.

:ref:`Figure 3 <merging_segmentations_together_fig3>` above shows the resulting merged segmentation, as displayed by widget
:doc:`Display <widgets/display>`.
As can be seen, :doc:`Merge <widgets/merge>` makes it easy to concatenate several strings into a single segmentation.
If the incoming segmentations contained several segments, each of them
would appear in the output segmentation.

**Exercise:** Can you add a new instance of :doc:`Merge <widgets/merge>`
to the workflow illustrated on :ref:`figure 1 <merging_segmentations_together_fig1>`
above and modify the connections (but not the configuration of existing
widgets) so that the segmentation given in :ref:`figure 4 <merging_segmentations_together_fig4>`
below appears in the :doc:`Display <widgets/display>`
widget? (:ref:`solution <solution_merging_segmentations_together_ex>`)
