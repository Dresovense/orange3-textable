Segmentation processing widgets
===============================

Widgets of this category take *Segmentation* data in input and emit data of
the same type. Some of them (:doc:`Preprocess <widgets/preprocess>` and :doc:`Recode <widgets/recode>`) generate
modified text data. Others (:doc:`Merge <widgets/merge>`, :doc:`Segment <widgets/segment>`, :doc:`Select <widgets/select>`,
:doc:`Intersect <widgets/intersect>` and :doc:`Extract XML <widgets/extract_xml>`) do not generate new text data but
only new *Segmentation* data. :doc:`Display <widgets/display>`, finally, is mainly used to
visualize (or export) the details of a given *Segmentation* object (content
and address of segments, as well as their possible annotations).
