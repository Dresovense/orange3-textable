**4. Segmenting data into smaller units**
=========================================

We have seen previously how to combine several segmentations into a
single one. We will often be performing the inverse operation: create a
segmentation whose segments are *parts* of another segmentationâ€™s
segments. Typically, we will be segmenting strings into words,
characters, or any kind of text units that will be later counted,
measured, and so on. This is precisely the purpose of widget
:doc:`Segment <widgets/segment>`.

To try it out, create a new workflow with an instance of :ref:`Text Field <widgets/text_field>`
connected to
:doc:`Segment <widgets/segment>`,
itself connected to
:doc:`Display <widgets/display>`
(see :ref:`figure 1 <segmenting_data_smaller_units_fig1>`
below). In what follows, we will suppose that the string typed in :doc:`Text Field <widgets/text_field>`
is *a simple example*.

    :doc:`Segment <widgets/segment>`
    widget

The interface of
:doc:`Segment <widgets/segment>`
(see :ref:`figure 2 <segmenting_data_smaller_units_fig2>`
below) illustrates a feature shared by most Orange Textable widgets: the
**Advanced settings** checkbox triggers the display of more complex
controls offering more possibilities to the user. For now we will stick
to the basic settings and leave this box unchecked.

    Figure 2: Interface of the :doc:`Segment <widgets/segment>` widget, configured for word segmentation

:doc:`Segment <widgets/segment>`
offers several parameters in the drop-down menu named segment type. Try
using them to segment the text into lines, letters, or words, then check
the result in
:doc:`Display <widgets/display>`.

The option of using a regular expression is quite powerful and we will
return to it later in this tutorial..
